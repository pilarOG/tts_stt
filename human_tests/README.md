# Recording participants and comparing API's

These are simple scripts to record samples from participants and to compare different TTS systems.

# Comparing API's

listening_test.py contains code to synthesize samples from three different TTS API's (AWS, IBM, Bing), play them and ask the participant through the terminal to select the preferred one.

# Recording participants

recording_samples.py is a simple script to, through the terminal, show texts to participants and record them reading out loud, saving each sentence as an individual wave file.
